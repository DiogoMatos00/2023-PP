I developed a Java project to create a bus simulator using threads, featuring multiple buses (threads) that pick up and drop off passengers between five cities. This project serves as an educational tool to understand multi-threading and concurrent programming paradigms. It includes various types of buses with different speeds and routes, simulating real-world scenarios. The simulator handles the complexity of buses transporting passengers to their destinations and incorporates random breakdowns (another thread), demonstrating how to manage asynchronous events. Additionally, users can interact with each bus, starting or stopping them, which illustrates thread control and synchronization.
